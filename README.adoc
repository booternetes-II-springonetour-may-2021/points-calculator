# Points Calculator

This implements a Spring Cloud Stream `sink` which provides a service to calculate rewards points for a new purchase amount.
This is intended to be used in a simple stream definition with http source, for example:

```bash
http | points-calculator
```

The points calculator sink is composed of two functions, defined as Spring beans:

```java
private static final int POINTS_MULTIPLIER = 100;

@Bean
public Function<Double, Integer> calculatePoints() {
return amount -> BigDecimal.valueOf(amount)
.setScale(2)
.multiply(BigDecimal.valueOf(POINTS_MULTIPLIER))
.intValue();
}

@Bean
Consumer<Integer> postPoints(HttpRequestFunction httpRequestFunction) {
    return points -> httpRequestFunction.apply(Flux.just(new GenericMessage(points)))
            .doOnError((Consumer<Throwable>) throwable -> logger.error(throwable.getMessage(), throwable)
            ).blockFirst();
}
```

The function `calculatePoints` is trivial. It merely, multiples the purchase amount by a multiplier, set to 100 in this case. Here we use BigDecimal, as
for recommended for financial calculations.

The `postPoints` uses a prepackaged `HttpRequestFunction`, available for streaming applications which need to make an external HTTP request, in a variety of
applications. HttpRequestFunction is a reactive function. With a signature of `Function<Flux<Message<?>>, Flux<Message<?>>>`, it accepts a stream of messages and
returns a stream of responses. The request and response body types, as well as the HTTP method to use, and the URL, are given declaratively be SpEL expressions.
In this case, we set static values where appropriate in `application.properties`.  The URL will be set at runtime.

Here, we wrap the core function inside a blocking `Consumer<Integer>`, since we don't require non-blocking I/O for this application

We declare a Spring Cloud Function composition by setting `spring.cloud.function.definition=calculatePoints|postPoints` in `application.properties`.
Composing a Function with a Consumer is logically equivalent to a Consumer, which is the functional implementation of a `sink`. A sink terminates a stream.
In other words, the HTTP request is fire-and-forget - we don't require a response.
